### ハーイ！ 👋

趣味でRust言語をほぼほぼメインにプログラミングをやっています。
かつてはC++erでしたが去年ごろからはRustacean。
動的型の言語よりも静的型言語の方が好きです。

基本的にはPC…具体的にはWindowsおよびLinux、およびSteamDeck上でのゲームの開発に興味があり、
マルチメディア処理の実装が一丁前に出来るようになればなと考えております。

本業はプログラミングおよびエンジニアリングとは関係ありません。

### 連絡方法

大変恐縮ではございますが、基本的に身内以外に
コミュニケーション手段を開放しておりません。
その為、もし私のソフトウェアに関するご連絡がございましたら、
対応するリポジトリの方に書き込んでいただけると幸いです。

しかしながら、当方は英語圏の在住ではなく、英語はあまり得意ではありません。
その為、ケースによっては応対できないことが有りうるかもしれませんし、
ジョークや言葉遊びの類は全く通じないものと考えられます。

そのことをご了承いただけると幸いに存じます。


### Hi there 👋

I do programming almost exclusively in the Rust language as a hobby.
I used to be a C++er, but since last year I am a Rustacean.
I prefer statically-typed languages to dynamically-typed languages.

Basically, I'm interested in developing games for the PC... specifically Windows and Linux, and SteamDeck.
I would like to be able to implement multimedia processing in a full-fledged way.

My day job is not related to programming or engineering.

The icons are my children, Tamaki and Tomoharu.
The two are a cute young lady and laid-back guy

We are very sorry, but basically we do not open our means of communication to anyone other than our own family members.
